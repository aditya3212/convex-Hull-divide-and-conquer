# convex-Hull-divide-and-conquer

In this code block I along with my team members have implemented convex Hull research paper. This algorithm preprocess the candidate point for convex hull using divide and conquur.  We have also compared with other algorithm and  it is faster than other algorithm such as Jarvis algorithm. For detail read the research paper attached to it.
